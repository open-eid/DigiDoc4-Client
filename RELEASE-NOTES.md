DigiDoc4 version 0.2.0 release notes
--------------------------------------

DigiDoc4 Client is an application for digitally signing and encrypting documents; the software includes functionality to manage (change pin codes, update certificates etc.) the Estonian ID-card. 

DigiDoc4 Client is a reinterpretation of two existing applications:
- DigiDoc3 Client which is used for digital signing and encryption;
- ID Card utility which is used for managing Estonian eIDs.
The functionality of the application mirrors existing applications; major changes provided by the new client are refreshed UI and the improvements in the workflow/UX of the application.
