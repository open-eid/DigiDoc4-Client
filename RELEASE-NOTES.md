DigiDoc4 version 0.2.0 release notes
--------------------------------------

DigiDoc4 Client is an application for managing Estonian eIDs and for viewing, creating and validating digital signature- and crypto-containers. DigiDoc4 Client is a reinterpretation of two existing applications:
- DigiDoc3 Client which is used for digital signing and encryption;
- ID Card utility which is used for managing Estonian eIDs.

The functionality of the application mirrors existing applications; major changes provided by the new client are refreshed UI and the improvements in the workflow/UX of the application.
