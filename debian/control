Description: Estonian digital signature application
 ID-software allows you to use your ID-card electronically – use
 private and governmental e-services, digitally sign documents
 and encrypt documents for safe transfer; the software includes
 utilities to manage (change pin codes, update certificates etc.)
 the Estonian ID-card.
 .
 DigiDoc4 Client can be used to sign digitally with ID-card and Mobile-ID, 
 check the validity of digital signatures and open and save documents 
 inside the signature container. Digitally signed containers are files 
 with .bdoc or .asice extensions; read-only support is provided for 
 older .ddoc format which can additionally be wrapped in .asics timestamped 
 container.
 .
 DigiDoc4 Client enables you also to secure files for safe transfer using
 your ID-card, and decrypt secured documents addressed to you. Securing or
 encrypting enables you to protect sensitive information from other
 people in the short term. The ID-card’s authentication certificate is
 used for encryption. A secure container file will be created upon
 encryption with the extension .cdoc.
